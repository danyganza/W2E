        <main>

            <p>MY name is Danny Ganza, I'm a boring dude, i like watching sports and playing whenever time allows it.
            </p>

            <p>Web development is a great program, almost 2 weeks in and i can already feel like it's something i enjoy
                and excited to get better at, a few challenges here and there but solving them makes it even more fun
            </p>
